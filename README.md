# Dash
This project is a part of a University course in data analytics. 
All data used in this project is fictional and altered to reflect real data. 
Built using Dash and developed in PyCharm, the dashboard is designed to track and display key inventory and sales data over the last six months, offering insights that can optimise inventory management. 
Below is the preview of the dashboard
